# Game Preview

# Requirements
This game requires python 3.7 (due to the strong type-checking used in the code). Python 4 works as well.
Besides that other libraries like pygame are required. Run the following commands to install all dependencies.

    pip install pygame
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    
# Training
This repository cames with a pre-trained model for the problem. This model is however not the best since it was trained over only 136 game episodes. You may want to train your own model. To do so run the following command:

    python train.py
    
# Running
To run the game using the current pre-trained model run the following command:

    python run.py
